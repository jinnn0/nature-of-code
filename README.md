# Nature of code

is to keep track of my experimentations on pysics simulations in 2d and the learning process is inspired by Nature of Code by Coding Train 


# Things I have been learning..

 **vector / vector maths** 
 **applying force**

 **oscillation / circular motion**
 **trigonometry**
 **collision detection**
 **elastic collision**
 **linear algebra**
 **particle system**
